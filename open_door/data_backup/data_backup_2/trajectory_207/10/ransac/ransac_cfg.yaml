# Set depth unit:
# In the input depth image, if depth[i, j] is x,
# then its real depth is (depth_unit*x) me  ters.
depth_unit: 0.001

# -- Algorithm (Prepare point cloud).

# Reduce image size to speed up computation.
img_resize_ratio: 0.2 # Choose from [1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1].

# In depth_img, truncate pixel value to zero
# if it's larger than this. (Unit: meter.)
depth_trunc: 1.2 #1.2

# After creating point cloud, downsample the point cloud.
# Unit: meter.
# If the value <=0, the downsample is disabled.

# -- Algorithm (Use RANSAC to detect plane).

RANSAC_config:
  # Minimum number of points in a valid point cloud:
  # Suppose the image size is 480/5 x 640/5 = 96 x 108,
  #   then there are totally 12288 points.
  #   If the plane shape relative to the image is (0.2, 0.2)
  #   then it has approximately 400 points.
  min_points: 5000 #800 / 8000

  iterations: 20 #10/100 # Number of iterations in the RANSAC algorithm.
  # More iterations cost more time, but may give better result.

  # A point is considered as part of the plane
  #   if its distance to the plane is smaller than this.

  # After RANSAC is completed, whether print result or not.

# -- Visualization
visualization:
  # Planes' colors are in this order: Red, yellow, green, cyan, purple.

  arrow_length: 0.2 # Length of the 3D arrow drawn on 2d image. Unit: meter.
